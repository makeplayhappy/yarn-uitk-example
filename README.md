# YarnSpinner Unity UI Toolkit example
A simple example of using Unity UI Toolkit with Yarn Spinner, this is just a reworked Line View and Option View from the standard Yarn Prefabs. Absolutely **not** production ready but hopefully provides a small leg up when you need an example to customise and improve .

The TypeWriter custom element is derived from a Unity forum post here https://forum.unity.com/threads/maxvisiblecharacters-for-typewriter-effect-any-way-to-recreate-this-in-uitoolkit.1066784/

It can be replaced if / when maxVisibleCharacters gets exposed in the API
